1) First of all I'm create a directory for my file's with multiple random lines. Then script create a file1 with uniq name and by cmd "du" check size of file1. Cmd "cut" is need to delete second word of "du" stdout.
2) Loop "while" check size of file and break if file size greter or equal of 1MiB (or 1048576 byte).
Random string is generated by "openssl" and then deleted all character exept num and letter.
Next script again check file size and print it in stdout in console.
3) Then I'm sort a file1. The most common cmd is "sort".If sort use without options file isn't change, because sort output is stdout in console. So, i use option "-o" to rewrite file1.
4) Next script create file2 like file1. By help cmd "sed" we can delete all line by pattern(reg expr) and change out of cmd in file2.
5)By cmd "wc" check all lines in file1 and file2, then make file1 - file2 and save this to var DL. Then print var DL to console.

exit 0 - successful execution
